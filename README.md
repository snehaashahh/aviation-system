You are finally launching the business you’ve been planning for years – an online PC shop! This shop will allow customers to buy from one of two main categories: custom builds (a computer that is built and customized to meet specific customer needs) and pre-built machines (complete systems assembled by well-known manufacturers using balanced hardware configurations). You currently only carry a relatively small (but powerful) inventory of items, but you want to give your customers the best experience possible anyways. You will be writing a program (using Python) that allows users to order items from your shop.
In this project, you will learn to:
- Creating functions
- Calling functions and using returned values
- User input in a loop
- Conditionals
- Lists, 2-D lists, and tuples
- String formatting for clean output
To begin, let’s note a few things. If your customers are building a computer, they absolutely must have these essential parts:
1. Central Processing Unit (CPU) for executing instructions
2. Motherboardforallowingcommunicationbetweencrucialcomponentsof
the system
3. Random Access Memory (RAM) for storing information that needs to be
retrieved quickly
4. Power Supply Unit (PSU) for powering the components within the system
5. Either a Solid State Drive (SSD) or a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) (or both) for
storage
6. Acaseforstoringthecomponents
